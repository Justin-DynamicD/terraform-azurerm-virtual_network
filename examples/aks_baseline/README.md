# Description

This example will create a vitual network in a resource group, creating 4 subnets with one dedicated for private service connections per the aks_baseline recomendations [here](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-baseline).  This demonstrates the flexibility of usingthis module in a larger CAF Landingzone scenario.
