# Description

This example will create a vitual network in a resource group, creating 4 subnets with one dedicated for private service connections, two for AKS, and a final for application gateway per the aks_baseline recomendations [here](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-baseline).  This demonstrates the flexibility of using this module in a larger CAF Landingzone scenario.
